# PDF Generation Attempts and Plans

## Attempted Approaches

### 1. Direct jsPDF Generation
- Created PDF using jsPDF library
- Implemented custom styling and layout
- **Issues Encountered:**
  - Image loading problems in Node.js environment
  - Font handling complications
  - Complex positioning for footer elements

### 2. Markdown with CSS to PDF
- Created styled Markdown template
- Attempted to use markdown-pdf package
- **Issues Encountered:**
  - npm installation errors
  - Package dependency conflicts
  - File system permission issues

### 3. Puppeteer Approach
- Tried using Puppeteer for HTML to PDF conversion
- Created conversion script with marked for Markdown processing
- **Issues Encountered:**
  - npm installation errors for Puppeteer
  - Package dependency conflicts
  - Environment setup challenges

## Current State
- Have working Markdown template (`seller-net-sheet-template.md`)
- CSS styling file ready (`style.css`)
- Basic layout and structure implemented
- Contact box positioning defined
- Empire Title branding colors set

## Suggested Next Steps

### 1. Browser-Based Approach
- Use browser's built-in PDF generation
- Steps:
  1. Create an HTML version of the template
  2. Add inline CSS for consistent styling
  3. Use print-to-PDF functionality
  4. Set margins to 40pt
  5. Choose Letter size paper

### 2. Standalone HTML Solution
- Create self-contained HTML file
- Include:
  - Embedded CSS
  - Base64 encoded images
  - Print-specific media queries
  - Proper page breaks

### 3. Third-Party Service Integration
- Research PDF generation services
- Options:
  - DocRaptor
  - PDFShift
  - WeasyPrint
  - Prince XML

### 4. Alternative Node.js Libraries
- Try newer PDF generation libraries:
  - PDFKit
  - HTML-PDF-Node
  - Playwright (alternative to Puppeteer)
  - ReactPDF
